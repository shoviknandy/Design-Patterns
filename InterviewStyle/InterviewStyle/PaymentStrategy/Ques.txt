You're working on a payment gateway system for an e-commerce platform. Customers can pay using:
1)Credit Card
2)PayPal
3)UPI

These payment methods are interchangeable and selected at runtime, depending on user preference.
Implement a Strategy Pattern to handle these payment methods.

Requirements:
Create a PaymentContext class that delegates the actual payment to a chosen strategy.
Define a IPaymentStrategy interface and implement different strategies for each method.
The context should be able to switch strategies dynamically if needed.

Bonus Points:
Add a method like ProcessOrder(string orderId, double amount) that utilizes the strategy.

Keep it clean and real-world-like.
